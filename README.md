# PhpStorm Laravel Code Style

This is a modified code style based on PSR-1/PSR-2, as per Laravel's [Contribution Guide](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/contributions#coding-style)

To use this coding style, drop the `Laravel.xml` file in the `/config/codestyles/` subfolder within your [configuration directory](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/help/project-and-ide-settings.html).
